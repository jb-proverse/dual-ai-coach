### 2. Set Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
# OpenAI API Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Backend Configuration  
PORT=3001

# Frontend Configuration (optional)
VITE_API_BASE=http://localhost:3001
VITE_USE_MOCKS=false
```

### 3. Start the Backend
