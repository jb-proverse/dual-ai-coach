# Dual‚ÄëAI Coach üöÄüß†

**Turn your learning goals into portfolio-ready projects with AI-powered guidance.**

## üéØ Why We Built This

**The Problem:** 70% of coding projects are abandoned before completion. Students start ambitious projects but struggle with:

**Backend Stack:**
- **Fastify** - High-performance Node.js server
- **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini** - AI-powered project generation and coaching
- **Rate Limiting** - Bulletproof API protection (5 requests/minute per IP)
- **Mock Mode** - Free development without API keys
- **CORS enabled** - Cross-origin requests
- **Template System** - Dynamic README and LinkedIn post generation

**AI Integration:**
- **Dual Personalities** - Engineer Coach (technical) vs Life Coach (motivational)
- **Context Awareness** - Responses based on current project and progress
- **Smart Prompts** - Persona-specific system prompts with expertise areas
- **Temperature Control** - Creative project generation (1.0) vs precise coaching (0.4-0.8)
- **JSON Responses** - Structured data for reliable frontend integration

**Design System:**
- **Colors:** Indigo (#6366F1), Purple gradients, Amber (#F59E0B), Gray scale
- **Typography:** Inter font for clean, readable text
- **Components:** Card-based layout with rounded corners and shadows
- **Animations:** Bounce effects, progress bars, confetti celebrations
- **Responsive:** Mobile-first design with breakpoints (768px, 1024px)
- **Accessibility:** ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- **Client-side mock fallbacks** - Works without backend for demos
- **localStorage persistence** - No database required for MVP
- **Static site deployment** - Deploy anywhere (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
- **Real-time sync** - StorageEvent listeners for cross-component updates
- **Bulletproof UX** - 10-second cooldowns, usage limits, graceful error handling
